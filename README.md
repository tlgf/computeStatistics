# computeStatistics
This is a toy project for me to fumble around the workings of c++ and github actions.

The tool (computeStatistics) is almost certainly useless - the compute required to generate it makes it a net negative contribution to the world.

I've tried to keep everything as minimal as possible, hopefully serving as a starting point for future c++ work.

So far it has covered some of the following:
* `boost`, including the `boost:project_options` cli handler
* `cmake`
* `conan.io`
